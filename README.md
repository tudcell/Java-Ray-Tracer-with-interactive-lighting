# Java-Ray-Tracer-with-interactive-lighting
Overview

This project is a simple ray tracer implemented in Java using JavaFX for rendering. It simulates how light interacts with spheres in a 3D space, featuring diffuse lighting, ambient lighting, and interactive sphere movement. The ray tracer supports multiple light sources and real-time rendering.

This project was developed as a learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of ray tracing, vector math, and real-time graphics rendering.

Features:
-Ray-Sphere Intersection: Accurately calculates where rays intersect with spheres.

-Diffuse Lighting: Simulates how light scatters when it hits a surface.

-Ambient Lighting: Adds a base level of illumination to the scene.

-Multiple Light Sources: Supports multiple light sources with adjustable positions.

-Interactive Sphere Movement: Allows users to drag and move spheres using the mouse.

-Real-Time Rendering: Renders the scene in real-time using JavaFX.

Technologies Used:
Java: Core programming language.

JavaFX: For rendering and user interaction.

Vector Math: For ray-sphere intersection and lighting calculations.
